INTRODUCTION     

The Virtualise system provides a limited form of virtual memory for RiscPC
dynamic areas. It is composed of two parts: A module which actually provides
the virtual memory, and a front-end which provides an easy to use interface
to most of the features.

The main features are:

    Simple to use WIMP front-end application to control virtual memory.
    The memory usage can be controlled using the bar in the Task Manager.
    Any number of virtual dynamic areas can be created and managed.
    Can create virtual dynamic areas larger than the amount of physical memory.
    Any dynamic area can be converted to/from virtual memory at any time.
    Supports draggable virtual dynamic areas and those with handlers.
    Intercepts OS SWIs to minimize changes required to existing applications.
    Supports memory accesses from USR26 and SVC26 modes.
    Pages may be locked to allow access from interrupt routines.
    Parameters for file operations are automatically locked and unlocked.
    File accesses transparently split to allow operations larger than memory.
    Handles all processor instructions, including coprocessor data transfer.
    Does not affect other programs that use processor hardware vectors.
    Global page allocation policy across all virtual dynamic areas.
    Choice of page replacement policies: NFU with ageing, FIFO or random.
    Whole WIMP tasks can be suspended and swapped to disc.

Read the "tutorial.txt" file for a quick introduction to using Virtualise. The
other parts of the documentation are described below.
