VERSION HISTORY

0.00 (17-Aug-95)    Original development version.

0.01 (31-Aug-95)    Added support for file operations. Attempts to reopen swap
                    file if closed.

0.02 (01-Sep-95)    Large file operations split so that they can be performed
                    using less physical memory.

0.03 (02-Sep-95)    Minimise area size before disabling virtual memory when
                    dynamic area removed without explicit call to end.
                    Fixed bug which surfaced when a memory access crosses a
                    page boundary and first page is already in memory.
                    Use transient CallBacks to optimise amount of memory used.
                    Interrupts disabled for more of Data abort handler to
                    cure (hopefully) spurious machine crashes.

0.04 (02-Sep-95)    Intercepts OS_ChangeDynamicArea and OS_DynamicArea to
                    reduce number of changes required to existing code.
                    Allows dynamic areas larger than memory to be created.

0.05 (03-Sep-95)    Disc operations minimized by tracking unused pages.
                    Pages swapped over in memory, rather than via swap file.
                    Page replacement policy changed from "first-in, first-out"
                    (FIFO) to "not frequently used" (NFU) with ageing.
                    Checks system variables to allow applications to use
                    virtual memory without any modifications.

0.06 (05-Sep-95)    Minor bug fixes. Optional debugging code included in
                    source code.

                    Changed useage of Virtualise_Configure.
                    Automatically releases memory if required for other uses.

0.13 (15-Sep-95)    OS_File write operations now correctly stamp files.

                    handler takes area base address as workspace pointer.
                    Only intercept handler if flags suitable for virtualising.

                    Added Virtualise_MiscOp to support external interrogation.

0.18 (28-Sep-95)    Extending area size only allocates space rather than
