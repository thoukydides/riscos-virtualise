The "!Virtualis" front-end will help you use virtual memory with application
which do not "know" about the module. However, some applications already have
support for Virtualise built in. At the time of writing these are:

    ProArtisan 24               1v02
    Composition                 1v02

These programs have dialogue boxes which allow configuration of the virtual
memory system. You do not need to use the !Virtualis front-end to make them
use virtual memory.

Some of the other applications that allow Virtualise to be used include:

    ArcWeb                      1v44
    ChangeFSI                   1v12
    EasyWriter Professional
    FontDirectory 2
    GNU C Compiler
    Grid Pro
    ImageFS 2
    Impression Style            3v05
    Impression Publisher        4v05
    Impression Publisher+       5v05
    Ovation
    OvationPro                  1v00
    Schema 2                    1v04
    Serenade                    1v10
    SparkFS
    TechWriter Professional
    TopModel                    1v11
    UnixLib                     3v7a
    Zap

Earlier versions of Composition will have problems loading files if you
virtualise it. You can virtualise ProArtisan 24 1v01 using the front-end.

Some applications do not create a dynamic area until a document is loaded.
!ChangeFSI is one of these. To virtualise these you need to load a file
before using the front-end.

PLEASE NOTE: Some versions of !ChangeFSI have a problem loading pictures
which are bigger than 32MB. This can result in a crash, but is not a problem
with Virtualise. It will happen on machines with sufficient RAM, whether
Virtualise is present or not.
